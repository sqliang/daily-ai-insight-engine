# Redeploying Fable 5

On Friday, June 12, the US government applied export controls to our newest models, Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5. This required us to restrict access to foreign nationals, whether inside or outside the United States. Because the order took effect immediately and we had no reliable way to verify nationality in real-time, we suspended access to both models for all users.

**As of today, June 30, the export controls on Fable 5 and Mythos 5 have been lifted.**

Fable 5 will be available starting tomorrow, Wednesday, July 1, to users globally on the Claude Platform, Claude.ai, Claude Code, and Claude Cowork. For Pro, Max, Team, and select Enterprise plans,1 Fable 5 will be included for up to 50% of weekly usage limits through July 7, after which it will be available via usage credits. We will re-enable access on AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Foundry as quickly as possible.

We have also restored access to Mythos 5 for a set of US organizations, following the US government’s approval on June 26. We continue to coordinate with the government to expand access to the broader set of domestic and international partners in the Glasswing program.

In the remainder of this post, we provide further details and updates in four areas:

*A timeline of events, including updates we made to our safeguards*. We discuss the events that led to the export control directive and how we addressed it with new safeguards.*Our general approach to safeguards*. We provide more context on how we use safety classifiers to detect potentially dangerous cybersecurity uses of our models.*A shared industry framework*. Although we have reached a constructive resolution, these events have made clear that the industry needs a consistent way to assess and fix potential “jailbreaks” of AI models (techniques that bypass a model’s safeguards).2A shared standard for judging the severity of a given jailbreak would help AI developers triage new findings as they arise, launch highly capable models with greater safety, and communicate the level of risk consistently to government and industry partners. Together with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and other Glasswing partners, we’ve started to develop such a framework, and we outline it below.*Deeper government collaboration*. We’re also strengthening our level of collaboration with the US government on new pre-release testing, information sharing, and research collaboration. We describe this deeper collaboration in the final section.

## Timeline and safeguard updates

We released Fable 5 and Mythos 5 on Tuesday, June 9. They both share the same underlying model, but Fable 5 was released with strong safeguards to make it safer for general use. Mythos 5, which has fewer safeguards, was only released to a small number of trusted Project Glasswing partners for use in defensive cybersecurity.
