description: 'arXiv:2607.05708v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent LLM-based agent
  systems continuously accumulate context across multi-turn interactions, tool invocations,
  and cross-session workflows. Replaying the full history for every request quickly
  becomes impractical: long contexts increase prefill cost, may exceed context limits,
  and often bury task-relevant evidence in irrelevant content, degrading both serving
  efficiency and output quality. We propose Akashic, a low-overhead memory system
  built around MemAttention, which organizes context into bounded chunks and models
  semantic relationships across chunks, preserving cross-chunk evidence without repeatedly
  rewriting the full history. Akashic further applies hardware-software co-designed
  memory placement to co-locate likely co-retrieved chunks, reducing retrieval fragmentation
  and I/O overhead. Across four representative workloads and three model sizes, Akashic
  improves task accuracy by up to 10.2 points, throughput by up to 1.21x, and sustainable
  request rate by up to 1.88x over strong prior memory baselines.'
