  see agentskills.io. Skills Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources
  that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills
  teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that''s
  creating documents with your company''s brand guidelines, analyzing data using your
  organization''s specific workflows, or automating personal tasks. For more information,
  check out: What are skills? Using skills in Claude How to create custom skills Equipping
  agents for the real world with Agent Skills About This Repository This repository
  contains skills that demonstrate what''s possible with Claude''s skills system.
  These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical
  tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications,
  branding, etc.). Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a SKILL.md
  file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these
  skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns
  and approaches. Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We''ve also
  included the document creation & editing skills that power Claude''s document capabilities
  under the hood in the skills/docx, skills/pdf, skills/pptx, and skills/xlsx subfolders.
  These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers
  as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI
  application. Disclaimer These skills are provided for demonstration and educational
  purposes only. While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the
  implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown
  in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities.
  Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for
  critical tasks. Skill Sets ./skills: Skill examples for Creative & Design, Development

  you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the document-skills
  plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Claude Code to do something like: "Use
  the PDF skill to extract the form fields from path/to/some-file.pdf" Claude.ai These

  as a starting point: --- name: my-skill-name description: A clear description of
  what this skill does and when to use it --- # My Skill Name [Add your instructions
  here that Claude will follow when this skill is active] ## Examples - Example usage
  1 - Example usage 2 ## Guidelines - Guideline 1 - Guideline 2 The frontmatter requires
  only two fields: name - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for
  spaces) description - A complete description of what the skill does and when to
  use it The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines
  that Claude will follow. For more details, see How to create custom skills. Partner

Note:This repository contains Anthropic's implementation of skills for Claude. For information about the Agent Skills standard, see agentskills.io.

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that's creating documents with your company's brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization's specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.

For more information, check out:

- Using skills in Claude

- Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills

This repository contains skills that demonstrate what's possible with Claude's skills system. These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.).

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md`

file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We've also included the document creation & editing skills that power Claude's document capabilities under the hood in the `skills/docx`

, `skills/pdf`

, `skills/pptx`

, and `skills/xlsx`

subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application.

**These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only.** While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.

- Select
`anthropic-agent-skills`

- Select

or`example-skills`

- Select
`Install now`


Alternatively, directly install either Plugin via:

You can use Anthropic's pre-built skills, and upload custom skills, via the Claude API. See the Skills API Quickstart for more.

Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a `SKILL.md`

file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the **template-skill** in this repository as a starting point:

```
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---
# My Skill Name
[Add your instructions here that Claude will follow when this skill is active]
## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2
## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

The frontmatter requires only two fields:

`name`

- A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)`description`

- A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it

The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Claude will follow. For more details, see How to create custom skills.
